# Ray Tracer

<p align="center">Sample Render</p>

A very simple WIP hobby CPU ray tracer with minimal GUI elements.   
  
Heavily based on *Ray Tracing In One Weekend*, *Ray Tracing from the ground up*, *PBRT* 

## Features (WIP)
- Multiple integrators: Path Tracing, Direct Illumination
- Materials: Matte, Reflective, Transparent, Emissive
- Lights: Directional, Point, Area
- 3D meshes in .obj format
- BVH Optimization
- Multithreaded rendering
- GUI

## External dependencies
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) + OpenGL 3 backend - for immediate mode GUI elements
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) math library for linear algebra, affine transformations and other geometry utilities
- [spng](https://github.com/randy408/libspng/) + [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) - for PNG encoding and decoding
- [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) for 3D meshes 

## Notes

#### Shading architecture
I found pbrt's approach of letting the Material populate a BSDF then returning it too complicated for the basic tracer I'm implementing here, so I followed the architecture of [2], where the material returns the color at the hit point. This might perhaps break other rendering algorithms like MLT or SPPM - TBD.

#### Area Lights
The natural way of implementing area lights is to use the area form of the rendering equation, but this conflicts with multiple importance sampling. Therefore, I used the approach pbrt takes, that is converting the PDF from area to solid angle. 

#### Textures
There are many things to improve regarding image textures, mostly sampling and filtering. At the moment, I do not see a reason to go through the trouble of implementing this. I just store the original image, as-is, relying on the high AA samples to deal with any artifacts regarding texture sampling. Elliptical weighted average does sound like a really interesting algorithm that I'd love to implement one day.
